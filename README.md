# 🚀 Jack Harter | Digital Architect & Strange World Explorer

**Adventurous Vagabond • Cloud-Native Polyglot • Homelab Hooplehead**

I thrive in the "weird and wild" corners of the tech world. 
From orchestrating complex container lifecycles to hardening network perimeters, I build resilient digital ecosystems that bridge the gap between scripts, hardware, and self-aware automation.

### 🛰️ Mission Log: Recent Expeditions
* **The Nomad Frontier:** Scaling a high-availability cluster across a trio of Micro PCs.
* **GitOps & Automation:** Refining **Kustomize** and **Consul** to ensure everything is versioned, verified, and "just_works™".
* **Network Hardening:** Deep-diving into firewall resilience to create a fortress for cloud and self-hosted services.
* **Artifact Musing:** Learning all I can about Unix, Vim, Bash, Git, and all the rough edges that keep us connected.

### 🧠 The Pursuit of Brilliance
I love tutorials; and after they're done, I architect solutions for strange and unknown environments.
* **Resilience:** Building systems that survive the chaos of digital gremlins and physical disasters.
* **Security:** Implementing Vault for secrets management because "good enough" isn't quite good, or enough.
* **Creativity:** Finding the perfect balance between high-end aesthetics and the raw power reliability.

### 🤝 Let's Collaborate
I’m always open to chatting about cloud-native patterns, homelab hardware, or the best Midwestern craft beers.

If you're somewhere near Cook County IL, let's meet up for some beer, coffee, or a fun run.

* **Connect:** [Linktree (Socials & Contact)](https://linktr.ee/jackharter)
* **Status:** Open to collaboration on open-source projects or networking architecture.

### ⚡ The "Secret Sauce"
> **Fun Fact:** My current production stack is a Proxmox VE cluster running Nomad on three Lenovo ThinkCentre micros.
> It used to be all stored on an M1 Mac Mini, but Apple doesn't really jive with upgrades or screwdrivers.
> This lets me experiment, expand, and learn more about the Hashicorp ecosystem.
