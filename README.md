# 👋 Hey there, I'm Jack Harter (@jharter1)

💻 Tech-tinkerer, homelab-constructor, and explorer of the cloudy & containerized.  
I love diving into the weird and wild world of self-hosted software, cloud services, and everything within them.

## 🚀 What I'm Into Right Now
- 🔧 Playing with **Docker Compose**, **Kustomize**, and **network firewalls**
- 🧪 Experimenting with **Nomad**, **Consul**, **Vault**, and GitOps workflows
- 🧵 Building my home lab around **automation**, **monitoring**, and **cool self-hosted tools**

## 🧠 Always Learning
- Cloud-native patterns
- Network security and resilience
- Making things just_work™ in strange and unknown environments

## ⚡ Fun Fact
My home lab has probably restarted more than your router—and that’s a *good* thing. 😄
